Pre-Application Process
-----------------------

### 1. Educational Credential Assessment

You need to get yourÂ **foreign** (not Canadian) educational credential
assessed by one of IRCC\'s [[approved third
parties]{.underline}](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessed/how.html).
The assessment is valid for 5 years. Most used options are:

1.  [[WES]{.underline}](https://www.wes.org/ca/) - ECA Application for
    > IRCC

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  IQAS

**It can take up to 2-3 months to get this done from scratch.**

### 2. NOC

This is needed to understand what your work experience is worth as
points are awarded for different types of Skills / TEER. You can check
your NOC code [[here]{.underline}](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/).

ðŸ’¡New 2016 vs 2021 mapping is
[**[here]{.underline}**](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/statistical-programs/document/noc2016v1_3-noc2021v1_0#wb-auto-2)

### 3. Language test 

*Covers English Only*

  Program   NOC           Canadian Language Benchmarks
  --------- ------------- ------------------------------
  **FSW**   **All**       **CLB 7**
  **CEC**   **NOC O/A**   **CLB 7**
  CEC       NOC B         CLB 5

We usually have profiles which are NOC A / TEER 1. There are [[two
exams]{.underline}](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/language-requirements/language-testing.html)
for English -

1.  [[IELTS]{.underline}](http://www.ielts.org/) - General Training

Express Entry (EE) Profile
--------------------------

There are three things we need before we can even create our EE profile
(see [[Pre-Application process]{.underline}](#pre-application-process))

1.  ECA

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  Language Test

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  NOC Code

You then create your EE profile by [[creating /
signing-in]{.underline}](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html)
your account with IRCC.

### 1. Start an application 

![](./media/image3.png){width="2.2041666666666666in" height="1.25625in"}

After you sign in, you can start an application

### 2. Check Eligibility 

**Unless you already have a personal code, click on the relevant option
in the do not have a personal code section**

![](./media/image5.png){width="2.1354166666666665in"
height="1.3104166666666666in"}

Most questions in this are pretty straightforward and you can keep
entering the details.

### 3. Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) Score 

CRS Score is the basis for us receiving Invite-to-Apply (ITA). You can
use the
[[tool]{.underline}](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp)
that is on IRCC website to evaluate your score even before you create
your EE profile.

The scoring is divided into sections of factors. You can experiment with
the tool to see how you can maximize your CRS Score.

Here are some areas where one can maximize points for CRS Score.

-   **Education** - Maximize credentials up to Masters / Double
    > Bachelors. This includes additional points for spouse as well.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Language Results** - Maximize scores CLB 9+ is what gets you max
    > scores. This includes additional points for spouse as well.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **International (non-Canadian) Work Experience** - In case you have
    > been with Cognizant for less than 3 years outside of Canada, reach
    > out to previous employers for Work Experience letters.

Here's an
[[article]{.underline}](https://moving2canada.com/comprehensive-ranking-system-express-entry/)
which explains the factors better.

### 4. Submitting EE Profile 

ðŸ’¡*At the stage of creating the EE Profile, you will only be asked for
adult co-applicants i.e., spouse and children over age of 18. Details
for children under 18 need to be filled only once you receive the ITA*

The Profile has a section for each adult candidate [only]{.underline}.

*AN: If anyone has a better explanation for it, please share it and I
will update*

#### Personal Details 

Personal details of the candidate.

#### Contact Details

Only Email now. more details are needed later

#### Education History 

This is the section your ECA credentials come in handy alongside your
Language test results.

ðŸ’¡Even if you have not gotten evaluation done for a particular degree,
you can enter the data and simply select ECA was not done.

#### Work History 

This section has your work history. Ideally, this should be work history
associated with your NOC.

An often-asked question - when does an applicant become qualified for
their NOC?

-   In some cases, it is the passing of a degree/masters.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   In others, it is the date when you first started in that role your
    > NOC describes

ðŸ’¡To maximize points and minimize paperwork, here's the thumb of rule on
how much history should be shared

1.  Max 3+ years of **non-Canadian experience**

2.  Minimum 1+ years of **Canadian experience**

*There will be a personal history section once you get ITA where will
have to fill in data for the last 10 years of your life, including being
employed, unemployed, student etc.*

#### Use of Representative

Only needed if you are using a consultancy or immigration lawyers.

ðŸ’¡Based on your score across sections IRCC will determine and qualify you
for all eligible streams
